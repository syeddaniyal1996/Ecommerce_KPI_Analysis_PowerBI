# Ecommerce_KPI_Analysis_PowerBI
The E-commerce KPI Analysis project focused on building an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor key performance indicators across sales, customers, and operations. The goal was to provide management with a single source of truth for business health, track growth trends, and enable data-driven decisions in real time.

# 📌 Recommendations from E-commerce KPI Analysis

# Boost Customer Retention

Focus marketing spend not just on acquiring new customers but on retaining repeat buyers, since returning customers usually have higher lifetime value (CLV).

Implement loyalty programs, personalized email campaigns, and subscription models.

# Optimize Product Mix

Double down on top-performing product categories that consistently drive sales.

For underperforming SKUs, either bundle them with popular items or phase them out to avoid inventory lock-up.

# Improve Conversion Rate

Review the checkout funnel and reduce friction (guest checkout, fewer steps, multiple payment options).

Use retargeting ads for cart abandonment to capture lost revenue.

# Enhance Operational Efficiency

Monitor fulfillment time & return rate KPIs closely. High return rates may signal product quality issues, misleading descriptions, or poor packaging.

Optimize supply chain and logistics to reduce delivery delays, especially in regions with lower customer satisfaction.

# Increase Average Order Value (AOV)

Upsell and cross-sell complementary products (e.g., “Frequently Bought Together”).

Offer free shipping thresholds (e.g., free delivery on orders above $50) to encourage bigger baskets.

# Geo-Targeted Growth Strategy

Scale marketing in regions showing the highest sales growth.

For low-performing regions, investigate shipping costs, delivery times, or lack of awareness.

# Channel Optimization

Identify which sales channels (website, app, marketplace) convert best and allocate budget accordingly.

Invest in mobile UX if mobile traffic is high but conversions are low.

# Profitability Tracking

Don’t just chase sales volume — monitor profit margins by product and channel.

Discontinue loss-making products or increase pricing where demand is strong.
